                    Words can't fully capture the depth of my gratitude for everything you've done for me. 
                    Your unwavering support, boundless patience, and endless love have shaped me into the person I am today. 
                    From the smallest acts of kindness to the grandest gestures, your presence has been a constant source of strength and joy in my life.<br><br>

                    Thank you for your wisdom, your humor, and your gentle guidance. 
                    You've been my rock, my mentor, and my friend. 
                    very memory we share is a treasure, and every lesson you've taught me is a gift I carry with me always.<br><br>

                    I am incredibly lucky to have you as my dad. 
                    Thank you for being the amazing person you are and for making my world a brighter, better place. <br><br>

                    With all my love,
                    Your child :)

                Thankyou for everything, especially putting up with my dumbass. 
                Thanks for always being there to fix things—especially the messes I’ve made. <br><br>
